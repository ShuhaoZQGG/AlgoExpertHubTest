<pre>1. define a function findBTrough return startIndex, endIndex, troughIndex
2. There might be multiple troughs
3. If multiple troughs, start from the longest trough, give value 1 to trough, and increment for his left and right neighbours
4. create a map, don't assign a value twice if the value is already assigned
5. go through smaller troughs and repeat the steps for them</pre>
