# Validate Subsequence


  Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines
  whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.


  A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
  in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For
  instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array
  [1, 2, 3, 4], and so do the numbers [2, 4]. Note
  that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid
  subsequences of the array.

Sample Input
array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]

Sample Output
true

# Branch Sums


  Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns a list of its branch
  sums ordered from leftmost branch sum to rightmost branch sum.


  A branch sum is the sum of all values in a Binary Tree branch. A Binary Tree
  branch is a path of nodes in a tree that starts at the root node and ends at
  any leaf node.


  Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a
  left child node, and a right child node. Children
  nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or
  None / null.

Sample Input
tree =     1
        /     \
       2       3
     /   \    /  \
    4     5  6    7
  /   \  /
 8    9 10

Sample Output
[15, 16, 18, 10, 11]
// 15 == 1 + 2 + 4 + 8
// 16 == 1 + 2 + 4 + 9
// 18 == 1 + 2 + 5 + 10
// 10 == 1 + 3 + 6
// 11 == 1 + 3 + 7
